##SymBrowser

###Created by Ryan D'souza


####Purpose
This bot allows you to browse the Internet and certain “Contexts”, while making it look like you’re doing work.
Right now, only the Reddit context is allowed, but one can get the text from any website in a format that looks like it is a long message from another Symphony user.
Other contexts can be implemented fairly easily through the bot’s modular design.
